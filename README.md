Title:
Multi-Task Management System with Login Authentication

Abstraction:
This Python program utilizes Tkinter to create a graphical user interface (GUI) that provides a login system with predefined credentials.
Upon successful login, the user is presented with a task selection window offering four different functionalities: file operations,
a simple calculator, text manipulation, and task list management.
Each functionality opens a new window with specific features for performing tasks such as listing, creating, and deleting files,
performing mathematical calculations, manipulating text (reversing and counting words), and managing a task list (adding, viewing, and deleting tasks).

Features:
Login Authentication: A simple login interface that authenticates users with a predefined username and password.
Task Selection: After successful login, users can choose from four tasks: file operations, simple calculator, text manipulation, and task list management.
File Operations: Enables users to list files in a specified directory, create new files with custom content, and delete existing files.
Simple Calculator: Allows users to input and evaluate mathematical expressions, displaying the result.
Text Manipulation: Offers functionalities to reverse text and count the number of words in the entered text.
Task List Manager: Users can add tasks to a list, view all tasks, or delete tasks from the list.
Error Handling: Appropriate error messages are displayed for invalid operations, such as invalid file paths or incorrect mathematical expressions.


Overview:
This Python program provides a simple yet versatile system with multiple functionalities to enhance user productivity.
The program begins with a login screen where users input their credentials. Upon successful login, they can choose one of the four tasks based on their needs.
The program uses Tkinter, a popular library for creating GUI-based applications in Python, making it accessible and user-friendly.
Each task option provides a separate window that contains relevant tools for interacting with the system, such as manipulating files, performing calculations, and handling text.
The program is structured with an easy-to-use interface, ensuring that even users without advanced technical knowledge can efficiently navigate and use the features provided.
